# About Me
I’m Wyatt and I enjoy bowling, gaming, volunteer firefighting, and going to work. I hope to get my two-year degree at waketech in cybersecurity and then transfer to a 4-year college. I have two dogs, two cats, a bird, and a horse. I love caring for my pets and I don’t know what I would do without them. I have lived in Fuquay all my life and I don’t think I will move too far away once I move out. I think it would be amazing to live either in Cary or somewhere in Harnett county with land. I also enjoy working on cars and have pulled apart my car and put it back together too many times. If you own a Honda Accord all I can say is good luck on replacing your water pump by yourself.

## Websites I Recommend
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) - I normally watch YouTube when I’m doing my school work just like I am right now and there are plenty of videos to watch on the platform. If you are looking for something interesting to watch or just background noise I couldn’t recommend it more. Some of the things I watch in the background are documentaries about recent topics, car videos, and random funny videos that come across my feed.
- [Facebook Marketplace](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/?ref=bookmark) - I love doomscolling things I can’t afford on here. I’ve bought plenty of things off this site and it’s always fun looking at potential project cars. Things I bought include a racing wheel for sim racing, a graphics card for my computer, car parts, and a stand for my bird. This website is great just make sure you know what you are looking for because something might be a good deal, but things might be wrong with it. For example, the 3080 I bought had overheating problems soon to find out but I fixed it with a new heat sync.
