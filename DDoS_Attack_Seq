# Documentation

Sequence Steps
1. Attacker: Commands the BotNet to start the DDoS attack.
2. BotNet: Sends a flood of requests to the WebServer, overwhelming it.
3. WebServer: Reports unusual traffic to the Firewall for analysis.
4. Firewall: 
   - Analyzes traffic, blocks malicious IPs, and restores normal service.
   - Logs and reports IPs for tracking and further action.

Defensive Measures
- Traffic Analysis: Firewall identifies attack patterns.
- IP Blocking: Malicious IPs are blocked to mitigate/stop the attack. (ex, rerouting, stopping, or systems like googles Rapid Reset)
- Reporting: Attack details are logged for use/reporting
