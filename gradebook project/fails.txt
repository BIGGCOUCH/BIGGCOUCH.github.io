gradebook.js:10 Could not get grades. Status: 500

The first few is due to me putting a capital letter in gradebook instead of all lowercase like I put in the code. Then after that I realized that I would need a password for it to work as it could fetch the data but not let me in so I put the password to admin and that fixed that issue. I also had a few things wrong like putting the wrong username and the table not populating so I had to change where the files where located and I had to put them into a public folder.
